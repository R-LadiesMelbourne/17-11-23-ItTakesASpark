# Challenge One

```{r, echo = F}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "", prompt = T, class.source="Rchunk", class.output="Rout", fig.align="center")
```

## Let's focus on the student's symptoms

We are going to use a new type of graph to do this, it's called a [bar plot]{style="color:purple"}.

For this we use `geom_bar()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = outbreak_data,
         aes(x =  sickness)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## How many students were and were not sick ?

As well as the bar plot, we can also use the `count()` command. 

```{r fig.align='center'}
outbreak_data %>% 
  count(sickness)
```

## What is making the studens sick ?

Sickness summarises all of the symptoms. Now it's time to get specific!

Can you make some other bar plots to see what the students were sick with?

- Remember we can use `colnames(outbreak_data)` to find out what information we have in `outbreak_data` ! 
- You might also like to try customising your plot. 
- Remember we can change the colour by specifying `fill =` within the `geom_bar()` command. You might also like to try `aes(fill = )`.

## Shortness of breath

```{r}
ggplot(data = outbreak_data,
       aes(x = shortness_of_breath))+
  geom_bar(aes(fill = shortness_of_breath))
```

What have you found? What symptoms are the most common ? 

## Reorganising our symptoms data

Data can be formatted in different ways. For example, prioritise having one row per individual with lots of columns. This is like our `outbreak_data`. 

Or sometimes we can change the format and so instead we have a long list of one observation per row. This is what we have in our `symptoms` data.

For the next few plots we are going to use `symptoms` and not `outbreak_data`, however they record exactly the same thing

## Bringing all the symptoms together

```{r}
ggplot(data = symptoms,
       aes(y = symptom, fill = status))+
  geom_bar()
```

## Bringing all the symptoms togther

```{r}
ggplot(data = symptoms,
       aes(y = symptom, fill = status))+
  geom_bar()
```

This doesn't necessarily help us to decide what is making the students sick because they are not separated as to whether they were [sick]{style="color:purple"} or not. We really want to separate those that have a [YES]{style="color:purple"} in `sickness`. 

## We can filter this list to just those that are sick !

This needs the `filter()` command

```{r}
symptoms_sick <- symptoms %>% 
  filter(sickness=="yes")
```

## Now, what symptoms do the sick students have ?

```{r}
ggplot(data = symptoms_sick,
       aes(y = symptom, fill = status))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title = "What symptoms do the sick students have ?")
```

## Interpreting our data

```{r}
ggplot(data = symptoms_sick,
       aes(y = symptom, fill = status))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title = "What symptoms do the sick students have ?")
```

What does this graph tell us?

-   What are the symptoms of those that are sick?

-   What might be some causes of illness that give these symptoms?

**What is salmonella?**

-   A bacterial infection

-   Commonly from contaminated food

-   Examples...undercooked chicken, raw egg, incomplete cleaning

-   You can start to feel sick within 6 to 36 hours after eating
