What is an infectious disease, what is an outbreak and who are disease detectives? How can R be used to investigate outbreaks? Then YOU are going to solve an outbreak! 2.1 What are infectious diseases? Infectious diseases are caused by certain microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or funghi, and will make people (or animals) sick when they are exposed to these microorganisms. Most microorganisms don‚Äôt make us sick, but some do, and these are known as pathogens. There are lots of different ways that you might get an infectious disease. Some ways include breathing respiratory droplets, eating contaminated food or water, insect bites and many many more ! 2.2 What is a disease OUTBREAK? The World Health Organisation definition of an outbreak as: the ‚Äúoccurence of disease in excess of normal‚Äù. In other words, a disease outbreak is the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season. An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or may extend over several countries. It may last for a few days or weeks, or for several years. This might be caused from a new pathogen, bringing pathogens to new areas, a mutating pathogen. Many infectious diseases now have vaccines that mean outbreaks to these pathogens occur much less frequently (for example: measles, chicken pox, influenza etc.). 2.3 Viruses 2023: Novovirus Outbreak Norovirus causes vomitting and diarrhoaea (you might call this gastro) It is extremely stable in the environment and highly contagious Ingesting norovirus causes disease There is no vaccine available for norovirus 2019: COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by a virus known as SARS-CoV2. It caused a global pandemic. A pandemic is defined as an infectious disease that is affecting multiple parts of the world, i.e.¬†multiple countries or continents are experiencing an epidemic There are now several types of vaccines that have helped to reduce the severity of this infection 2014: Ebola Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a severe fever that often causes fatal illness and affects humans and other primates. This virus is transmitted to people from animals (e.g., fruit bats, porcupines) Ebola spreads in human populations by direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and contaminated surfaces and materials The first outbreaks occurred in villages in Central Africa and the 2014-2016 outbreak was the largest. For more information on the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak see the World Health Organisation website. 2009: Swine Flu ‚ÄúSwine-Flu‚Äù or the 2009-2010 H1N1 Influenza A outbreak was the first recorded time in human history that this virus caused infections in humans. It was called swine flu and was a combination of influenza viruses that infect pigs, birds and humans. It was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in 2009 and there were approximately 284,400 deaths worldwide. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. This virus continues to circulate as a seasonal virus. The seasonal flu vaccine now helps protect against this strain of flu and other seasonal flu viruses. For more information see the World Health Organisation website. 2.4 Bacteria Mycobacterium ulcerans: Buruli ulcer Image: Institut Pasteur Buruli ulcer is caused by a bacteria known as Mycobacterium ulcerans The bacteria is slow growing and flesh eating and is endemic to Melbourne and surrounds Endemic means that there is an ongoing transmission of a pathogen in that area Mode of transmission not entirely understood but likely involves mosquitoes and possums Jan 2024 Update ! Scientists find out how M. ulcerans is spread. Yersinia pestis: Black Death The Plague or Black Death is a disease caused by a bacteria known as Yersinia pestis. Infections occur when humans are bitten by a rodent flea that carries this bacterium or by an infected animal. This disease was infamous in killing millions of people in Europe in the Middle Ages. Symptoms include headache, chills, weakness, swollen lymph nodes, among others depending on the type (Bubonic, Septicemic, Pneumonic). But today we have modern antibiotics that can treat Yersinia pestis. More information on the plague can be found on the Centre for Disease Control website and the World Health Organisation website. 2.5 Who are real-life disease detectives? Public health departments in the government How to improve the health of everyone Academic research at Research Institutes and Universities Make new discoveries, such as developing new drugs or vaccines Doctors and health staff Keep their patients safe And many others too ! An epidemiologist is someone who investigates the patterns and causes of health and disease. 2.6 What do real-life disease detectives do? What is the problem ? What is the cause? What can we do to make the situation better ?

Local authorities are unsure of the cause of this outbreak, but it appears to be linked to a recent excursion to Melbourne CBD. The Excursion Students at a local school went into Melbourne to see an exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria. At 8am, they took the bus to the NGV. They were in the gallery from 9am - 12pm. They had lunch from 12pm - 2pm at three different locations They went back to the gallery for another exhibition between 2 -4 pm At 4pm they were back on the bus to go home The Investigation And you have been given some information including: Name Class Age Sex Height Weight Was the student feeling sick What were their symptoms And we are going to do this in R !

We first need to load in the packages that we will be using and our data. üîç What are packages? One of the great things about R is that there are lots of pre-installed commands that we can access or ones that others help to create and we can access. These are our packages that we access with the library() command. Packages can help us inspect our data using simpler language. We are using the packages tidyverse Wickham et al. (2019) and ggmap Kahle, Wickham, and Jackson (2023). &gt; library(tidyverse) &gt; library(ggmap) &gt; source(here::here(&quot;setup/setup.R&quot;)) üí° If library(tidyverse) or library(ggmap) is not working, then the packages may not be installed. To do this, simply run install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"ggmap\")) in the console or in the code chunk. 5.2 What does outbreak_data look like ? The number one step in data analysis is looking at the data we have to work with. For this, we are going to use our first pre-installed command called colnames(). &gt; colnames(outbreak_data) [1] &quot;firstname&quot; &quot;class&quot; &quot;height&quot; &quot;weight&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;sex&quot; [7] &quot;temperature&quot; &quot;sickness&quot; &quot;shortness_of_breath&quot; &quot;chills&quot; &quot;palpitation&quot; &quot;bloody_stools&quot; [13] &quot;pain_chest&quot; &quot;abdominal_cramps&quot; &quot;dizziness&quot; &quot;nausea&quot; &quot;vomiting&quot; &quot;vertigo&quot; [19] &quot;cough&quot; &quot;fever&quot; &quot;diarrhea&quot; &quot;constipation&quot; &quot;headache&quot; &quot;pain_abdominal&quot; [25] &quot;throat_sore&quot; &quot;muscle_pains&quot; Can you find outbreak_data in the environment pane? What happens if you click on it there? 5.3 Different kinds of data In outbreak_data we have several kinds of information and it‚Äôs important to identify what these are ! How would you describe what data we have in Firstname? How is this different to Weight ? What are some terms we could use to define these ? To look specifically at one column we can select the column using a pipe or %&gt;%. &gt; outbreak_data %&gt;% select(height) # A tibble: 29 √ó 1 height &lt;dbl&gt; 1 61.7 2 60 3 60.5 4 61.7 5 62 6 62.3 7 60.9 8 60.3 9 62.7 10 61 # ‚Ñπ 19 more rows 5.4 Visualising data The types of data we have to work with will determine how it is best to visualise ! A scatter plot: &gt; mpg %&gt;% + ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty)) + + geom_point(size = 3)+ + labs(y = &quot;&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;) Notice both the x and the y-axis are things we can count or measure. A boxplot: &gt; mpg %&gt;% + ggplot(aes(x = class, y = cty)) + + geom_boxplot()+ + labs(y = &quot;&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;) Notice the y-axis are things we count or measure but the x-axis are specific groups. 5.5 Plotting our data We will be using a function called ggplot(). This is a fantastic tool we can use to make amazing graphs ! Like any graph we need to decide: What do we want on the x-axis? What do we want on the y-axis? What kind of graph do we want to make? Other ideas like colour, design, groups ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll get to this later! &gt; ggplot(data = outbreak_data, + aes(x = class, y = height)) These are both pieces of data represented by numbers - how else might we record data? 5.5.1 How to ask ggplot to plot outbreak_data &gt; outbreak_data %&gt;% + ggplot(aes(x = age, y = weight)) + + geom_point() Next we choose what kind of graph we need 5.5.2 We can use geom_point() or geom_boxplot() Let‚Äôs first try geom_point(). We use the + sign to add it to our first ggplot command. &gt; outbreak_data %&gt;% + ggplot(aes(x = class, y = height)) + + geom_point() Where would we put geom_boxplot() ? 5.5.3 Now swap height for temperature on the y-axis. &gt; ggplot(data = outbreak_data, + aes(x = class, y = temperature))+ + geom_point() 5.6 Let‚Äôs customise! Can you change size, shape and colour‚Ä¶what kinds of plots can you make ? &gt; ggplot(data = outbreak_data, + aes(x = class, y = temperature))+ + geom_point(size = 4, shape = 5, colour = &quot;blue&quot;) 5.6.1 Boxplots to create summaries Can you make a boxplot with Class on the x-axis and Temperature on the y-axis? A boxplot summarising temperature in the four classes. &gt; ggplot(data = outbreak_data, + aes(x = class, y = temperature))+ + geom_boxplot() üí° Boxplots provide us with an informative summary of the data in our groups - The center line gives the median - the box below is 25% of the data below the median and the box below is 25% of the data above üí° If we don‚Äôt know what R is doing, we can always get help ! &gt; ?geom_boxplot() 5.6.2 How can we use fill to learn more ? The fill can be specified as aesthetics like the x and y axis. Can you specify the fill with our Sickness information about each student ? &gt; ggplot(data = outbreak_data, + aes(x = class, y = temperature, fill = sickness)) + + geom_boxplot() 5.6.3 What does temperature tell us about how the students were feeling? Were the temperatures the same for students who were sick and those who weren‚Äôt Where the sick students in all classes Why do people get a temperature when they get sick? 5.6.4 Time to give our plot a title &gt; ggplot(data = outbreak_data, + aes(x = class, y = temperature, fill = sickness))+ + geom_boxplot()+ + labs(title = &quot;Make a title here !&quot;) Make it something informative that describes the plot you‚Äôve just made and why people would be interested to look at it 5.7 Generating summaries This symbol %&gt;% is used to send our data into another command such as summarise(). As the name would suggest, we can generate summaries, such as calculating the median. &gt; outbreak_data %&gt;% + summarise(median = median(temperature)) # A tibble: 1 √ó 1 median &lt;dbl&gt; 1 37 üí° We can also calculate other summary statistics in R. Such as: outbreak_data %&gt;% summarise(median_age = median(age), min_age = min(age), max_age = max(age), mean_age = mean(age)) 5.8 We can also use group_by() with multiple groups Just like our boxplot, we want to know the median temperature of the students, grouped by their Class and Sickness status. Try to do this by adding group_by(Class, Sickness). &gt; outbreak_data %&gt;% + group_by(class, sickness) %&gt;% + summarise(median = median(temperature)) `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;class&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument. # A tibble: 8 √ó 3 # Groups: class [4] class sickness median &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 A no 36.5 2 A yes 39 3 B no 37 4 B yes 39 5 C no 37 6 C yes 39 7 D no 37 8 D yes 39 How can we relate this to the boxplot we made earlier ?

For this we use geom_bar() &gt; ggplot(data = outbreak_data, + aes(x = sickness)) + + geom_bar() 6.2 How many students were and were not sick ? As well as the bar plot, we can also use the count() command. &gt; outbreak_data %&gt;% + count(sickness) # A tibble: 2 √ó 2 sickness n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 no 18 2 yes 11 6.3 What is making the studens sick ? Sickness summarises all of the symptoms. Now it‚Äôs time to get specific! Can you make some other bar plots to see what the students were sick with? Remember we can use colnames(outbreak_data) to find out what information we have in outbreak_data ! You might also like to try customising your plot. Remember we can change the colour by specifying fill = within the geom_bar() command. You might also like to try aes(fill = ). 6.4 Shortness of breath &gt; ggplot(data = outbreak_data, + aes(x = shortness_of_breath))+ + geom_bar(aes(fill = shortness_of_breath)) What have you found? What symptoms are the most common ? 6.5 Reorganising our symptoms data Data can be formatted in different ways. For example, prioritise having one row per individual with lots of columns. This is like our outbreak_data. Or sometimes we can change the format and so instead we have a long list of one observation per row. This is what we have in our symptoms data. For the next few plots we are going to use symptoms and not outbreak_data, however they record exactly the same thing 6.6 Bringing all the symptoms together &gt; ggplot(data = symptoms, + aes(y = symptom, fill = status))+ + geom_bar() 6.7 Bringing all the symptoms togther &gt; ggplot(data = symptoms, + aes(y = symptom, fill = status))+ + geom_bar() This doesn‚Äôt necessarily help us to decide what is making the students sick because they are not separated as to whether they were sick or not. We really want to separate those that have a YES in sickness. 6.8 We can filter this list to just those that are sick ! This needs the filter() command &gt; symptoms_sick &lt;- symptoms %&gt;% + filter(sickness==&quot;yes&quot;) 6.9 Now, what symptoms do the sick students have ? &gt; ggplot(data = symptoms_sick, + aes(y = symptom, fill = status))+ + geom_bar()+ + labs(title = &quot;What symptoms do the sick students have ?&quot;) 6.10 Interpreting our data &gt; ggplot(data = symptoms_sick, + aes(y = symptom, fill = status))+ + geom_bar()+ + labs(title = &quot;What symptoms do the sick students have ?&quot;) What does this graph tell us?
